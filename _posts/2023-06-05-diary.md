I don't know why, but it seems like I cannot focus on something for a while. The duration is maybe a few days or a few weeks, but I cannot make it last longer than one month.

I have tried some strategies, such as creating atomic habits and doing daily status checks. I noticed that when I started these strategies, I felt excited and wanted to continue. However, once I stopped, it became difficult for me to start again. Consequently, I completely forget about it for a while. This is the reason why I cannot maintain continuity. It is hard for me to start doing something once I've stopped.

But why is it so easy for me to start watching TV or something similar? What are the differences between starting to watch TV and starting to learn?

The reason might be that 
1. I anticipate having a hard time if I start to learn, even if that's not the case.
2. I dislike this feeling, so I avoid starting to learn altogether.

How can I avoid this situation?

1. Incorporate a reward system after achieving each learning goal.
2. Accept and embrace these feelings.
