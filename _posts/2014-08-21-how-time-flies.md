It has been 40 days since my parents visit us in Shanghai. In the past 40 day, I didn't need cook and do my garocy and lundry. I acted like I was the host of the house, and they were the guests.

But I don't think we had a very good time during these day. My sister and I always complain about mom's cooking and unclean, complaining about dad's doing nothing but watching tv and serf the internet. Mom complaining how the dress me and my sister, and Dad complaining how we should work harder.

I don't why we are all complaining each other, and I don't think it is a good way to live together. We(Me and my sister) are not hoping they will come to visit next year, but they keep insist that they will come next year.

How should I say about this situation, maybe we should think about each other on these shoes. They only have this summer holiday to visit, they cooked and paied money for us, but instead of welcoming them, we are complaining.

I don't know how to make them to think positive, but at lease I should think positive, and next year need to behave better and more polite. They are our parents and we should respect them.
