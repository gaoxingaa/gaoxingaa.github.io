# Sentence 
```In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.```

# Phrases
## In another moment
"In another moment" means "in a short time" or "after a very brief moment."

## Down went Alice after it
The phrase "Down went Alice after it" is an example of a construction known as inversion, where the normal word order is flipped for stylistic or emphatic reasons. 
Normal Word Order: In English, the usual subject-verb-object word order is subject + verb + object. A more standard phrasing of this sentence would be:
"Alice went down after it."
Inversion: In this sentence, the subject ("Alice") and the verb ("went") are inverted. The verb "went" is placed before the subject "Alice" for emphasis or stylistic effect. This inversion is often used in literary or poetic contexts to create a sense of urgency, drama, or flow.

## Never once
"Never once" is an expression that means "not even once" or "at no point." It's used to emphasize that something did not happen even a single time, highlighting a complete lack of occurrence.

## In the world 
The phrase "in the world" is often used to add emphasis, especially when expressing surprise, confusion, or frustration. It can be roughly understood as meaning "in all of existence" or "in all of the possible things that could happen."
