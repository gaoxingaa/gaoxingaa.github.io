[Writing in 5 Minutes](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app/write?limit=5&type=minutes)

Hello, I just would like to have a try to see how many words I can type in just 5 minutes without 5 seconds break. It sounds a little dangerous and also a little ridiculous. But anyway I'm here now and I like this app. Looks like it makes me more focused and doesn't care about the misspelled and good so far.

How many words I have typed? Look like two hundred. I cannot figure it out. I just lost the ability to count, even I can type.

Today is not a good day, but we still need to focus and make it better, right? As an old one says, you cannot get a bad solution for this bad problem. How bad is it? Is it the hell? I don't know, but what I know for sure is that I need to change, and it is not late. I should say, it is never late.

So, it is like now or never.

Oh, look what I found, I found the place where to show the words. Now there are 178 words, and I'm done.

I'm so proud of myself.
