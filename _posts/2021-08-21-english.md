## Dictation


### Cannot hear clear
short ... li

We will explore shortened clauses. 

### Grammar
Clause is group of words with subject and predict.

subject predict

Clause is independent: [I] (subject) [love grammar] (predict).
 
Clause is dependent: [I] (subject) [think that I (subject) love grammar (predict)] (dependent predict). 


Dependent clause after that can be replaced if the verb is guess, think, hope.

[I] (subject) [think that I (subject) love grammar (predict)] (predict). 
[I] (subject) [think that so] (predict).
