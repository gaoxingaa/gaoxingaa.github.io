I have got my first github pr merged to the community. So happy. Hope I can continue.
I have some github pr before, but they are all for the work purpose.
This time it was my own contribution to the current blog theme I'm using right now.
Look like it is not so difficult or feel overwhelmed for me.

Keep Learning, Keep Coding.
